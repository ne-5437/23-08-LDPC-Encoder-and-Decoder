## Project Overview

Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are powerful error-correcting codes used in modern communication systems. This project involves the development and testing of LDPC encoding and decoding algorithms to ensure accurate data transmission.

### Key Features:
- **LDPC Encoding**: Implemented using a generator matrix approach to encode input data.
- **LDPC Decoding**: Utilized the Bit-Flipping Decoding method for error correction.
- **Hardware Design**: Both algorithms were implemented in Verilog for hardware applications.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Verified functionality and performance using Xilinx Vivado 2023.1.
